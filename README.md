## Set up git and configuring with Github account:octocat:

This configuration can be done in windows, using github bash and similarly in linux.

### Installing Git
Download the installer for Windows from the Git [official site](https://git-scm.com/download/).

Git for Windows comes with Git Bash (it's own command prompt), and it looks better than Windows default prompt. 

### Set up git 

- First we need creates a new ssh key, using the provided email as a label. Open Git Bash after installation and type: 
``` console
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@domain.com"
```
It will return: 
``` console
Generating public/private rsa key pair.  
Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa): [Press enter]
```
Press Enter. This accepts the default file location.

Then he asks for a password. This password will have to be typed every time you download something from a repository or send something there. You can leave it blank. This is your choice. If you want to leave without, just enter. If not, enter the password and confirm.
``` console
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): [Type a passphrase]  
Enter same passphrase again: [Type passphrase again]
```
It will return a confirmation: 
``` console 
Your identification has been saved in /Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa.  
# Your public key has been saved in /Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
# The key fingerprint is:
# 08:21:02:ca:85:d6:42:d2:00:f9:43:9d:f0:a2:db your_email@domain.com
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 4096]----+
|    ..      .    |
+----[SHA275]-----+
```
- Start the ssh-agent in the background. Let's activate it:
``` console
$ exec ssh-agent bash [Press enter]
$ eval ssh-agent -s [Press enter]
```
It will return something like that: 
``` console
SSH_AUTH_SOCK=/tmp/ssh-9S2E7m94sl07/agent.18936; 
export SSH_AUTH_SOCK;
SSH_AGENT_PID=18172; 
export SSH_AGENT_PID;
echo Agent pid 18172;
```
- Add your SSH key to the ssh-agent:
``` console
$ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa [Press enter]
```
It will return: 
``` console 
Identity added: /c/Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa (your_email@domain.com)
```
- Copies your SSH key to your clipboard
``` console 
$ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub > /dev/clipboard 
```

2. Logged into your GitHub account, go to the top right options, click your profile picture:

`Settings > SSH and GPG Keys > New SSH Key`

Give a title to your key, and past the key int the blank large box.

### Testing if your configuration is correct
Still on Git Bash: 
``` console
$ ssh -T git@github.com
```
It will return: 
``` console 
Hi username! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
```
Then everything is correct!

Now anytime you clone a repository, GitHub will automatically give you the `SSH URL` and you will have to provide your `SSH key` paraphrase anytime you push and pull changes and you will not need to type in your username or your password anymore.

### Add your Git username and set your email

Important: every Git commit will use this information (username and email) to identify you as the author.

Add your username:
```
git config --global user.name "YOUR_USERNAME"
```

Set your email address: 
```
git config --global user.email "your_email_address@example.com"
```

Obs.: Youâ€™ll need to do this only once, since you are using the `--global` option. Check global infos: `git config --global --list` 

### Basic Git Commands
```
# View your remote repositories
git remote -v

# Create a branch
git checkout -b NAME-OF-BRANCH

# Work on an existing branch - To switch to an existing branch, so you can work on it:
git checkout NAME-OF-BRANCH

# View your remote repositories
git remote -v

# Send changes to gitlab/github.com - To push all local commits to the remote repository:
git push REMOTE NAME-OF-BRANCH
